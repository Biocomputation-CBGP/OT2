# OT2

Directory dedicated to the files (scripts, labware definition, manuals, etc) relative to the Opentrons robot.

### 3PrinterLabware
Folder with the files needed to print some of the custom labware and adaptors that we use in our protocols

### Folders related to genotypic validation of libraries
There are several folders that contain the scripts, files, labware definition and examples needed to perform the [High-throughput workflow for the genotypic characterization of transposon library variants](dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kqdg394jzg25/v1).

It is divided in folders because all of them can be used in an independant way:
* **AntibioticPlatesGeneration**
* **Colony Selection**
* **MergingSamplesSourcePlates**
* **PCRsamplePreparation**

### Custom_labware
Folder with the testing and working definition of the labware that we have used or currently using in all OT-2 protocols.

These files are obtained from the [custom labware creator](https://labware.opentrons.com/create/) and they are all json files.

### Informations
Useful documentation to create protocols, use them and customized them to our purposes.
